Title: Compass New Project STARTER PACK
Description: Every time I begin a new Compass front end development project I copy and paste these assets into the new project folder and is my starting point. You'll notice a compass icon in the parent directory. If you have compass installed on your mac, double clicking this icon will start compass and watch whatever folder the icon is currently in. Great way to quickly start compass without getting into terminal.
